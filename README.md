This is a Project work undertaken in context of partial fulfilment of BCA. I have tried our best to make the Phone Number Tracking System using Python.
In today’s environment, a mobile has become one of the important necessities. 
If a person is grabbed in problem due to false or fraud calls by others again and again then our system is helpful to solve this problem by tracking the related phone number which includes phone number location country name, time zone and service provider of that number. 
Here a phone number tracking system has developed without purchasing and using extra devices and no need to pay for this service. 
User can use this system free of cost. This system contains a window which is asking for the phone number from user and search button which shows phone number details after click on it and here how it is works. 
This system also helps to solve cybercrimes related to phone numbers to find location, SP and time zone of that contact number.
Our system can be used in the cyber cell after adding some more useful modules to solve cybercrimes, related to fraud calls using phone numbers and also it will be helpful to find our friends, family members and others using it without anyone’s help by tracking phone number and also useful for find out mobile devices by tracing them.
